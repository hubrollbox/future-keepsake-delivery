# CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY FIX - Recipients Table

## üö® URGENT SECURITY ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED

**Date:** January 28, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Status:** FIXED

## Vulnerability Description

A critical security vulnerability was discovered in the `recipients` table Row Level Security (RLS) policies that could expose sensitive personal data of all recipients to unauthorized users.

### The Problem

The migration file `20250724000000_add_rls_policies.sql` created dangerous RLS policies that reference a non-existent `user_id` column in the `recipients` table:

```sql
-- DANGEROUS POLICY - REFERENCES NON-EXISTENT COLUMN
CREATE POLICY "Usu√°rios podem ver apenas seus pr√≥prios destinat√°rios" 
  ON public.recipients FOR SELECT 
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);  -- user_id DOES NOT EXIST!
```

### Why This Is Critical

1. **Data Exposure Risk**: The `recipients` table contains highly sensitive personal information:
   - Full names
   - Email addresses  
   - Phone numbers
   - Complete physical addresses (street, city, postal_code, country)

2. **Policy Failure**: Since `user_id` doesn't exist in the `recipients` table, these policies would fail to properly restrict access, potentially allowing:
   - Unauthorized data access
   - Identity theft
   - Fraud attempts
   - Harassment
   - Spam campaigns

3. **Incorrect Table Structure**: The `recipients` table uses `keepsake_id` to link to `keepsakes.id`, not a direct `user_id` column.

## The Fix

### Migration Applied

Created `20250128000000_fix_recipients_security_vulnerability.sql` which:

1. **Removes Dangerous Policies**: Drops all policies that reference the non-existent `user_id` column
2. **Implements Secure Policies**: Creates proper RLS policies that:
   - Allow users to access only recipients for keepsakes they own
   - Allow administrators full access
   - Use the correct `keepsake_id` relationship

### Secure Policy Implementation

```sql
-- SECURE POLICY - USES CORRECT RELATIONSHIP
CREATE POLICY "recipients_secure_keepsake_owner_access" ON public.recipients
  FOR ALL USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.keepsakes 
      WHERE keepsakes.id = recipients.keepsake_id 
      AND keepsakes.user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

## Verification Steps

After applying the fix, verify security with these queries:

### 1. Check RLS Status
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename = 'recipients';
```
**Expected Result**: `rowsecurity` should be `true`

### 2. List Current Policies
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'recipients';
```
**Expected Result**: Only secure policies should be present:
- `recipients_secure_keepsake_owner_access`
- `recipients_secure_admin_full_access`

### 3. Test Access Control
```sql
SELECT r.* 
FROM recipients r
JOIN keepsakes k ON r.keepsake_id = k.id
WHERE k.user_id = auth.uid();
```
**Expected Result**: Only recipients for the current user's keepsakes should be returned

## Impact Assessment

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå Potential exposure of all recipient personal data
- ‚ùå Ineffective access controls
- ‚ùå High risk of data breaches
- ‚ùå Compliance violations (GDPR, privacy laws)

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Proper access controls in place
- ‚úÖ Users can only access their own recipients
- ‚úÖ Administrators have controlled full access
- ‚úÖ Sensitive data properly protected
- ‚úÖ Compliance requirements met

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Apply the migration `20250128000000_fix_recipients_security_vulnerability.sql` immediately

2. **Security Audit**: Conduct a comprehensive review of all RLS policies across all tables

3. **Testing Protocol**: Implement automated tests to verify RLS policies work correctly

4. **Code Review**: Establish mandatory security review for all database migrations

5. **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for any policy changes to sensitive tables

## Prevention Measures

1. **Schema Validation**: Always verify column existence before creating RLS policies
2. **Security Testing**: Test all RLS policies with different user roles
3. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date table schema documentation
4. **Peer Review**: Require security-focused code reviews for database changes
