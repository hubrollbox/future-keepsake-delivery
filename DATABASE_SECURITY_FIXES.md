# Database Security Fixes

This document outlines the critical security vulnerabilities that were identified and the comprehensive fixes implemented to secure the FuturoPresente database.

## Security Vulnerabilities Addressed

### 1. PUBLIC_USER_DATA - Profiles Table
**Issue**: The 'profiles' table was publicly readable, exposing email addresses and personal information.
**Risk**: Data harvesting for spam, phishing attacks, and privacy violations.
**Fix**: Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies restricting access to authenticated users viewing only their own profiles.

### 2. EXPOSED_SENSITIVE_DATA - Recipients Table
**Issue**: The 'recipients' table was publicly accessible, containing email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses.
**Risk**: Identity theft, fraud, spam, and privacy violations.
**Fix**: Restricted access to keepsake owners and authorized administrators only.

### 3. PUBLIC_PAYMENT_DATA - Payments Table
**Issue**: Payment information including amounts, transaction IDs, and payment methods were publicly readable.
**Risk**: Financial fraud, competitive intelligence theft, and privacy violations.
**Fix**: Limited access to payment owners and authorized administrators only.

### 4. EXPOSED_PERSONAL_MESSAGES - Keepsakes Table
**Issue**: Personal message content intended for specific recipients was publicly accessible.
**Risk**: Privacy violations and unauthorized access to private communications.
**Fix**: Restricted access to message senders and authorized recipients only.

### 5. PUBLIC_NOTIFICATION_DATA - Notifications Table
**Issue**: Notification content containing personal information was publicly readable.
**Risk**: Exposure of private user activities and communications.
**Fix**: Limited access to notification recipients only.

### 6. SUPA_function_search_path_mutable
**Issue**: Database functions lacked explicit search_path settings, creating SQL injection vulnerabilities.
**Risk**: SQL injection attacks and unauthorized database access.
**Fix**: Added explicit `SET search_path = public, extensions` to all custom functions.

### 7. SUPA_auth_leaked_password_protection
**Issue**: Leaked password protection was disabled in authentication settings.
**Risk**: Users could use compromised passwords from data breaches.
**Fix**: Implemented password strength validation and documented required Supabase configuration changes.

## Migration Files Created

### 1. `20240101000000_implement_rls_security.sql`
This migration implements comprehensive Row Level Security policies for all vulnerable tables:

- **Profiles Table**: Users can only access their own profile data
- **Recipients Table**: Only keepsake owners and admins can access recipient information
- **Payments Table**: Only payment owners and admins can view payment records
- **Keepsakes Table**: Only senders and authorized recipients can access keepsake content
- **Notifications Table**: Only notification recipients can view their notifications
- **Admin Override**: Administrators have full access for management purposes

### 2. `20240101000001_fix_function_search_path.sql`
This migration addresses function security vulnerabilities:

- Sets explicit `search_path` for all custom functions
- Creates secure functions for:
  - Keepsake delivery scheduling
  - Payment processing
  - Notification sending
  - User statistics retrieval
- Implements proper authentication and authorization checks
- Grants appropriate permissions and revokes public access

### 3. `20240101000002_enable_auth_security.sql`
This migration enhances authentication security:

- Implements password strength validation function
- Creates failed login attempt logging
- Adds suspicious activity detection
- Documents required Supabase dashboard configurations
- Creates auth security configuration tracking

## Implementation Instructions

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd c:\future-keepsake-delivery

# Apply the migrations using Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Or apply them individually
supabase db push --file supabase/migrations/20240101000000_implement_rls_security.sql
supabase db push --file supabase/migrations/20240101000001_fix_function_search_path.sql
supabase db push --file supabase/migrations/20240101000002_enable_auth_security.sql
```

### Step 2: Configure Supabase Dashboard Settings
The following settings must be configured through the Supabase Dashboard:

1. **Authentication Settings**:
   - Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
   - Set minimum password length to 8 characters
   - Enable "Strong Password" requirements
   - Enable email confirmation
   - Configure appropriate session timeout
   - Enable rate limiting for auth endpoints

2. **Database Settings**:
   - Verify RLS is enabled on all tables
   - Review and test all security policies
   - Monitor function execution permissions

### Step 3: Update Application Code
Ensure your application code respects the new security policies:

1. **Authentication Required**: All database operations now require proper authentication
2. **Authorization Checks**: Verify users can only access their own data
3. **Admin Functions**: Ensure admin role checks are properly implemented
4. **Error Handling**: Update error handling for authorization failures

### Step 4: Testing
Thoroughly test the application to ensure:

1. **Authenticated Access**: Users can access their own data
2. **Access Restrictions**: Users cannot access other users' data
3. **Admin Functions**: Administrators have appropriate access
4. **Function Security**: All custom functions work with new security policies
5. **Authentication Flow**: Login, registration, and password reset work correctly

## Security Policy Details

### Row Level Security Policies

#### Profiles Table
- `"Users can view own profile"`: Users can SELECT their own profile data
- `"Users can update own profile"`: Users can UPDATE their own profile
- `"Users can insert own profile"`: Users can INSERT their own profile
- `"Admins can manage all data"`: Admins have full access to all profiles

#### Recipients Table
- `"Keepsake owners can view recipients"`: Users can view recipients of their keepsakes
- `"Keepsake owners can insert recipients"`: Users can add recipients to their keepsakes
- `"Keepsake owners can update recipients"`: Users can modify recipients of their keepsakes
- `"Admins can manage all recipients"`: Admins have full access

#### Payments Table
- `"Users can view own payments"`: Users can view their payment history
- `"Users can insert own payments"`: Users can create payment records
- Admin access for payment management

#### Keepsakes Table
- `"Senders can view own keepsakes"`: Users can view keepsakes they created

### Function Security

All custom functions now include:
- Explicit `SET search_path = public, extensions`
- `SECURITY DEFINER` for controlled execution
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Proper error handling and validation

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Security Checks
1. Review failed login attempts regularly
2. Monitor suspicious activity patterns
3. Audit user access patterns
4. Review and update security policies as needed

### Automated Cleanup
- Failed login attempts are automatically cleaned up after 30 days
- Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting

## Compliance Notes

These security fixes help ensure compliance with:
- **GDPR**: Personal data protection and access controls
- **PCI DSS**: Payment data security (if applicable)
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability controls
- **General Security Best Practices**: Defense in depth, least privilege access

## Support and Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after applying these fixes:

1. Check Supabase logs for authentication errors
2. Verify RLS policies are correctly applied
3. Ensure application code handles authorization properly
4. Review function permissions and execution context
5. Test with different user roles (regular user, admin)
